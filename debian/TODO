- the Adobe sourcesans pro font needs to be packaged in debian (see https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=683774). Once this is done, it will need to be added to depends, so that Diviner (and probably other applications) do not render with a fallback font
- allow ssl in webserver configuration
- add nginx autoconfiguration option in post{inst,rm}
- create a mysql user that only has access to phabricator databases (security)
- allow to configure upload limit?
- fix bug: avoid the need to purge the package to be able to configure the webserver again (a simple remove will leave the webserver not configured)
